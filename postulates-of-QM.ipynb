    "### **Need of Quantum Mechanics**\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, we choose different theories depending on the scale of motion and the accuracy we need. For example, when a particle is moving at a speed that is comparable to the speed of light, classical Newtonian mechanics is no longer sufficient, and relativity must be applied. However, relativity is not limited only to high speeds—it is a universal theory that works at all scales. The reason we do not apply it for everyday speeds is because the relativistic factor  \n",

    "$$ \n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "is almost equal to $1$ when $v \\ll c$. In such cases, the results from relativity reduce to those of Newtonian mechanics, which are much simpler to work with. In a very similar spirit, quantum mechanics becomes necessary when the effects governed by Planck’s constant cannot be neglected. The value of **Planck’s constant** is  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "h = 6.62 \\times 10^{-34} \\, Js \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "and whenever we are dealing with systems where actions are of the order of this magnitude, quantum mechanics provides the correct description. Nevertheless, quantum mechanics is also a complete and universal theory that works at all scales, but for large macroscopic systems, we prefer classical mechanics because it avoids unnecessary complexity while still giving practically correct results.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key differences between classical and quantum mechanics lies in how we handle measurements. In classical mechanics, the position of a particle can, in principle, be measured exactly and represented as a precise number. Errors only arise due to the least count of measuring instruments, and often we ignore these in large-scale systems. But in the microscopic domain of quantum mechanics, such errors can never be ignored. Measurements are fundamentally limited, and therefore quantum mechanics avoids the assumption of perfect measurement altogether. Instead, quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic—it talks in the language of probabilities rather than certainties. While in classical mechanics we try to find the exact trajectory or position of a particle, in quantum mechanics we calculate the probability of finding a particle in a certain region of space.\n",
    "The natural question is: how do we compute such probabilities? The central object in quantum mechanics is the wavefunction, denoted by $ \\psi(r) $ for position dependence, or more generally $ \\Psi(r,t) $ for the time-dependent case.\n",
    "This wavefunction is obtained as a solution to a differential equation that governs the dynamics of the quantum system. However, the wavefunction itself can take complex or negative values, and probability cannot be negative or complex. To resolve this, we construct the probability density $\\rho(r,t)$ by multiplying the wavefunction with its complex conjugate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\rho(r,t) = \\Psi(r,t) \\times \\Psi^{*}(r,t) \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees that the probability density is always a non-negative real number. Once we have the probability density, the actual probability of finding the particle in a certain region between $a$ and $b$ is given by an integral:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "probability = \\int_{a}^{b} \\rho(r,t) \\, dr \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, quantum mechanics links the abstract wavefunction to measurable quantities through this procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the crucial point is: which differential equation should we solve to obtain the wavefunction? We essentially have two choices—either the Schrödinger equation or Maxwell’s equations. The choice depends on the physical situation we are describing. If the detection process involves charge being deposited on a detector, the Schrödinger equation is used to describe the evolution of the wavefunction. On the other hand, if no charge is involved during detection, the system is more appropriately described using Maxwell’s equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a complete quantum mechanical prediction for any physical system proceeds in the following logical steps: first, select the appropriate differential equation (either Schrödinger or Maxwell) according to the situation; second, solve this equation to obtain the wavefunction; third, multiply the wavefunction by its complex conjugate to obtain the probability density; and finally, calculate the probability of finding the particle in a given region by integrating this density. Symbolically, the procedure can be summarized as  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "Probability = \\int_{a}^{b} \\Psi(r,t)\\Psi^{*}(r,t) \\, dr \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of steps forms the backbone of quantum mechanics and highlights why it is both a probabilistic and a universal theory, essential whenever classical mechanics ceases to give an accurate description."

    "Quantum mechanics, unlike classical mechanics, cannot be derived from more fundamental principles. Instead, it is built upon a set of basic statements called *postulates*. These postulates provide the framework within which all quantum phenomena are described. Let us go through them one by one in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Postulate 1: State of a Quantum System**  \n",
    "At any given time, the complete information about a quantum system is contained in a mathematical object called a *state vector* or *ket*, usually written as $|\\psi\\rangle$. This state vector lives in a mathematical space called a Hilbert space, which is essentially a complex vector space equipped with an inner product. The state vector is normalized such that  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = 1 \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "meaning the total probability of all possible outcomes is $1$. For systems like a spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ particle, the Hilbert space is two-dimensional, while for a particle moving in space it is infinite-dimensional. In quantum computing, this postulate tells us that a qubit is represented by a vector such as  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "with complex numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that satisfy \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Postulate 2: Observables and Measurements**  \n",
    "Every measurable physical quantity (such as position, momentum, energy, or spin) corresponds to a mathematical operator called an *observable*. Observables are represented by Hermitian operators (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Hilbert space. The possible outcomes of a measurement are given by the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator, and the state of the system collapses into the corresponding eigenvector after the measurement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the system is in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and we measure an observable $\\hat{A}$ with eigenvectors $|a_i\\rangle$ and eigenvalues $a_i$, then the probability of obtaining the result $a_i$ is given by  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(a_i) = |\\langle a_i | \\psi \\rangle|^2 \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "and immediately after this measurement, the system will be in the state $|a_i\\rangle$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, this explains why measuring a qubit in the computational basis collapses a superposition state into either $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ with probabilities given by the squared amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Postulate 3: Time Evolution of a Quantum System**  \n",
    "The evolution of a closed quantum system is deterministic and governed by the Schrödinger equation. If the state at time $t$ is $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$, then its time evolution is determined by the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$ of the system as  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "i \\hbar \\frac{d}{dt} |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\hat{H} |\\psi(t)\\rangle \n",

    "|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t,t_0) |\\psi(t_0)\\rangle \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $U$ is unitary, meaning $U^\\dagger U = I$. This ensures that probabilities are preserved during time evolution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the quantum computing context, this postulate tells us that quantum gates must always be represented by unitary matrices, because only unitary transformations preserve the normalization of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Postulate 4: Composite Systems**  \n",
    "When we consider multiple quantum systems together, their joint state is described by the tensor product of their individual Hilbert spaces. For example, if system $A$ is in state $|\\psi_A\\rangle$ and system $B$ is in state $|\\psi_B\\rangle$, then the combined system is in the state  \n",

    "|\\psi_{AB}\\rangle = |\\psi_A\\rangle \\otimes |\\psi_B\\rangle \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads naturally to the idea of entanglement. Not all combined states can be written as simple tensor products; some states are inseparable and are called entangled states. Entanglement is one of the most striking non-classical features of quantum mechanics and forms the basis of quantum computing and quantum communication. For example, the Bell state  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle) \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "cannot be factored into separate states for the two qubits, and yet it represents a valid composite quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Postulate 5: Probability Rule (Born’s Rule)**  \n",
    "Although not always listed separately, an essential postulate is that the probability of any measurement outcome is obtained by applying the Born rule. If the system is in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and we measure an observable with eigenvector $|a_i\\rangle$, then the probability is given by  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "P(a_i) = |\\langle a_i | \\psi \\rangle|^2 \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This rule links the abstract mathematics of quantum mechanics to experimental predictions. Without it, we would have no way to interpret the meaning of the wavefunction.\n",
    "In summary, the postulates of quantum mechanics provide the backbone of the theory: states are represented by vectors in Hilbert space, observables are Hermitian operators with eigenvalues as possible outcomes, measurements collapse the system to eigenstates with probabilities given by the Born rule, time evolution is governed by unitary dynamics arising from the Schrödinger equation, and composite systems are described by tensor products of individual states. These postulates may seem abstract at first, but they are precisely what allows us to build and reason about quantum computers, where qubits evolve unitarily under quantum gates and yield probabilistic outcomes upon measurement.\n"
